# Toyota Nexus - Environment Variables Example
#
# NOTE: This application uses localStorage for API keys (frontend-only demo).
# These environment variables are provided as examples for a production setup.
#
# To use Gemini AI in the chatbot:
# 1. Get an API key from https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
# 2. Configure it in the chatbot settings (gear icon)
#
# For production, you would use server-side environment variables:

# VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
# VITE_GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-flash

# Note: Vite exposes environment variables prefixed with VITE_ to the client.
# Never commit real API keys to version control!
