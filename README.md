## 🤖 Chatbot Modes

### MOCK Mode (Default)

The chatbot uses pre-programmed, rule-based responses. **No API key required.**

**Capabilities:**
- Vehicle recommendations by type (hybrid, SUV, budget-friendly)
- Model comparisons (e.g., "Compare Camry vs. Corolla")
- Lease vs. finance explanations
- Vehicle-specific information searches
- Budget and safety recommendations

**Try these:**
```
"Best hybrids under $400/mo"
"Compare Camry vs. RAV4"
"Tell me about the Prius"
"Explain lease vs finance"
```

### Gemini AI Mode (Optional)

Enable advanced AI responses using Google's Gemini API.

**Setup:**

2. Sign in and create an API key
3. In the chatbot, click the settings gear icon
4. Paste your API key and select a model
5. Click "Save Settings"

**⚠️ Security Warning**: API keys are stored in browser localStorage and sent directly to Google's API. This is a **frontend-only demonstration**. In production, API keys should be stored securely on the server.

**Available Models:**
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash** (Recommended): Fast responses
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro**: Advanced reasoning
- **Gemini Pro**: Legacy model

## 🔐 Authentication

This app uses **simulated authentication** for demonstration purposes:

- **Sign Up**: Enter name, email, and password (min 6 characters)
- **Login**: Use the same email/password
- **Session**: Stored in browser localStorage
- **Protected Routes**: `/app/*` routes require authentication
- **Logout**: Click user menu → Sign Out

> **Note**: In production, you would integrate a real authentication service like Firebase, Auth0, or your own backend API.

---

## 💰 Finance Calculations

The payment simulator uses standard amortization formulas:

### Financing Formula

```
M = P[r(1+r)^n]/[(1+r)^n-1]

Where:
  M = Monthly payment
  P = Principal (amount financed)
  r = Monthly interest rate (APR / 12 / 100)
  n = Number of payments
```

**Example Test Case:**
- MSRP: $30,000
- Down payment: $3,000
- APR: 5.5%
- Term: 60 months
- **Expected monthly: ~$513.45**
- **Total paid: ~$30,807**
- **Total interest: ~$3,807**

### Leasing Formula

```
Monthly Payment = Depreciation Fee + Finance Fee

Depreciation Fee = (Adjusted Cap Cost - Residual Value) / Term
Finance Fee = (Adjusted Cap Cost + Residual Value) × Money Factor

Money Factor = APR / 2400
```

2. **Mock Authentication**: Authentication is simulated with localStorage.
3. **API Key Security**: Gemini API key stored in localStorage (not production-safe).
4. **Vehicle Images**: Using placeholder images from Unsplash.
5. **No Real Data**: Vehicle pricing and specs are realistic but not live from Toyota.
6. **Payment Estimates**: Simplified calculations for demonstration purposes.
